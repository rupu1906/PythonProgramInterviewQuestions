# Python does not have built-in support for generics in the same way that languages 
# like Java or C# do.Generics, in those languages, allow you to define classes, methods, 
# or functions that can work with different data types while maintaining type safety. 
# In Python, you can achieve similar functionality using dynamic typing and duck typing.

# However, there are ways to implement a form of generics or type constraints in Python:

# Type Hints (Annotations):

# Python 3.5 and later support type hints, which allow you to specify the expected data types 
# of variables, function parameters, and return values using annotations.

from typing import TypeVar, List

T = TypeVar('T')

def first_item(items: List[T]) -> T:
    return items[0]

result = first_item([1, 2, 3])

# Custom Generics (Using TypeVar):
# You can use the TypeVar class from the typing module to create custom generic types.

from typing import TypeVar, List

T = TypeVar('T')

def process_items(items: List[T]) -> List[T]:
    # Process items
    return items

result = process_items([1, 2, 3])

# Third-Party Libraries:

# Some third-party libraries, like mypy, Pyright, and pytype, provide static type checking
# and additional support for generics.
# These tools can help enforce type constraints and provide more rigorous type checking, 
# similar to how generics work in statically-typed languages.
# While Python's type hints and dynamic typing provide flexibility and readability in code,
# they do not offer the same level of compile-time type safety as languages with strong static
# typing and built-in generics. Python's approach relies on conventions and documentation to 
# ensure proper usage of data types.

# It's essential to strike a balance between using type hints for clarity and documentation 
# and writing tests to validate the behavior of your code with various data types.
